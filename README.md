## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** the exercise files
2. **Activate** your virtual environment with Qiskit installed
3. **Start with Part 1:**
   ```bash
   python quantum_exercises_01_basics.py
   ```

### Recommended Learning Path
1. **Read the introduction** in each file before starting
2. **Run exercises sequentially** - each builds on previous concepts
3. **Experiment with parameters** - modify code to deepen understanding
4. **Complete practice problems** - test your knowledge
5. **Move to next part** only after mastering current concepts

### Interactive Learning
For a more interactive experience, you can convert the Python files to Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Or use JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

## üí° Usage Tips

### Understanding the Code Structure
Each exercise file follows this pattern:
- **Docstring explanation** of concepts and objectives
- **Helper functions** that implement quantum operations
- **Main exercise functions** with step-by-step implementations
- **Analysis sections** explaining results and insights

### Debugging and Troubleshooting
- **Check your Qiskit version:** `python -c "import qiskit; print(qiskit.__version__)"`
- **Verify simulator:** Most exercises use `AerSimulator()` for local simulation
- **Reduce shots** if simulations are slow (default is usually 1000)
- **Check circuit depth** for complex algorithms

### Customization Ideas
- **Modify parameters** in variational algorithms
- **Change problem sizes** (number of qubits, data points)
- **Implement different ans√§tze** for VQE and QAOA
- **Create your own oracles** for search problems
- **Experiment with different feature maps** for quantum ML

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: No module named 'qiskit'**
```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
```

**Slow Simulation**
- Reduce the number of shots: `simulator.run(circuit, shots=100)`
- Use smaller circuits for testing
- Consider using statevector simulator for noise-free simulations

**Circuit Too Deep**
- Some algorithms may create deep circuits that are slow to simulate
- Try reducing the number of layers or iterations
- Use `transpile()` to optimize circuits

**Memory Issues**
- Large quantum circuits can use significant memory
- Start with small examples (2-4 qubits)
- Close unnecessary applications when running simulations
