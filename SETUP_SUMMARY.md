2. **Package Installation**: Installed modern versions of Qiskit (2.1.0) and dependencies:
   - `qiskit` (2.1.0) - Main quantum computing framework
   - `qiskit-aer` (0.17.1) - High-performance quantum circuit simulator
   - `matplotlib` (3.10.3) - For visualizing quantum circuits and results
   - `jupyter` - For interactive notebook development
   - `numpy` (2.3.1) - Numerical computing support

3. **Code Updates**: Updated test scripts and validation functions to work with the latest Qiskit API
4. **Testing**: Verified all components work correctly with quantum circuit creation and measurement

## 🚀 What's Available

### Quantum Computing Exercises
Located in the `Exercises/` directory:

#### Easy Level:
- `Easy_Single_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Learn basic quantum gates (X, H, Z, S)
- `Easy_Multiple_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Work with multi-qubit systems and CNOT gates

#### Medium Level:
- `Medium_Single_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Advanced single qubit operations
- `Medium_Multiple_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Complex multi-qubit circuits

### Key Features:
- ✅ Working validation functions for exercises
- ✅ Quantum state visualization capabilities
- ✅ Measurement and statistical analysis
- ✅ Bell state creation and entanglement
- ✅ Bloch sphere visualization

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Activate the Environment
```bash
source qiskit_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. Open an Exercise
Navigate to the `Exercises/` folder and start with:
- `Easy_Single_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` for beginners
- Or any exercise that interests you!

### 4. Test Your Setup (Optional)
```bash
python3 test_mvp.py
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Python Version**: 3.13
- **Qiskit Version**: 2.1.0 (Latest)
- **Simulator**: AerSimulator (High-performance)
- **Operating System**: Linux 6.8.0-1024-aws
- **Virtual Environment**: `qiskit_env/`

## 📚 Quick Reference

### Essential Quantum Gates:
- `qc.x(0)` - Bit flip (NOT gate)
- `qc.h(0)` - Hadamard (creates superposition)
- `qc.z(0)` - Phase flip
- `qc.s(0)` - S gate (π/2 phase)
- `qc.cx(0,1)` - CNOT gate (control=0, target=1)

### Creating a Basic Circuit:
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

# Create circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)  # Put first qubit in superposition
qc.cx(0, 1)  # Create entanglement
qc.measure_all()

# Run simulation
backend = AerSimulator()
job = backend.run(qc, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start with Easy Exercises**: Begin with single qubit gate exercises
2. **Learn Key Concepts**: Superposition, entanglement, measurement
3. **Experiment**: Try creating your own quantum circuits
4. **Explore Visualizations**: Use the built-in plotting functions
5. **Advanced Topics**: Move to medium-level exercises when ready
