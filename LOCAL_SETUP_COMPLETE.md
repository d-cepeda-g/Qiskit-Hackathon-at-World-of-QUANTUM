# 🎉 Qiskit Hackathon - Local Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

Your Qiskit Hackathon project is now configured to run locally with the following components:

### 📦 Installed Dependencies
- **Qiskit 2.1.0** - Quantum computing framework
- **Qiskit Aer** - Quantum simulators
- **Qiskit IBM Provider** - IBM Quantum hardware access
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy** - Scientific computing libraries
- **IPython Widgets** - Interactive notebook components

### 🛠️ Created Files
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `setup_local.py` - Automated setup script
- `start_local.sh` - Quick start script
- `exercises_levels/` directory structure with validation functions
- Updated `README.md` with local setup instructions

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

1. **First time setup** (already completed):
   ```bash
   python3 setup_local.py
   ```

2. **Start working with notebooks**:
   ```bash
   ./start_local.sh
   ```

3. **Manual start** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd Exercises
   ~/.local/bin/jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
   ```

### 📚 Available Exercises
Navigate to the `Exercises/` directory to find:
- `Easy_Single_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Introduction to quantum gates
- `Easy_Multiple_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Multi-qubit operations
- `Medium_Single_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Advanced single-qubit techniques
- `Medium_Multiple_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` - Complex quantum circuits

### 🔧 System Configuration
- **Python Version**: 3.13.3 ✅
- **Installation Method**: User-level packages (--break-system-packages)
- **Jupyter Location**: `~/.local/bin/jupyter`
- **Environment**: Adapted for externally-managed Python

### 🎯 What You Can Do Now

1. **Start Learning**: Run `./start_local.sh` to launch Jupyter
2. **Begin with Basics**: Open `Easy_Single_Qubit_Gates.ipynb` 
3. **Interactive Learning**: Each notebook has validation functions to check your solutions
4. **Visualizations**: Bloch sphere plots and circuit diagrams work out of the box

### 🌐 IBM Quantum Integration
To access real quantum hardware:
1. Create account at [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)
2. Get your API token
3. In a notebook, run: `IBMQ.save_account('your_token_here')`

### 🚨 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure you're in the project root directory
- Check that `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH
- Try the manual jupyter command shown above
- All notebooks should work with the installed packages

### 🎊 You're Ready!
The project is fully configured for local development. You can now explore quantum computing with Qiskit without needing any cloud services or additional setup!
